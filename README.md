# "The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need" with ThePrimeagen's Frontendmasters Course Solo Project 
### A GitHub repository created to deepen my understanding and learning in areas like Big(O) analysis, complex algorithms, data structures such as stacks and trees, and graph traversal techniques like BFS and DFS.

### Key Takeaways:
- Advancing algorithmic techniques for problem-solving
- In-depth understanding of Big(O) notation and its application
- Mastering of data structures and graph traversal algorithms

### Overall, this gave me comprehensive knowledge in advanced algorithms, Big(O) analysis, and data structures, providing a strong foundation for software development and problem-solving.

## Preview of work done:

## KEY NOTES: ONLYADDIFYOUNEEDDISCLAIMERS!!!
* The first Carousel was made with Bootstrap NPM 
* The second Carousel was made with Alice-Carousel NPM in a `Class` Component 
* The third Carousel was made with Alice-Carousel NPM in a `Function` Component 

## Steps to recreate:

### In console:
`
npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
`

`
npm i react-alice-carousel
`

### Add these lines to the App.js file:
```
import {
  Checkbox,
  Sidebar,
} from 'semantic-ui-react';
import AliceCarousel from 'react-alice-carousel';

import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';
import 'react-alice-carousel/lib/alice-carousel.css';
```
